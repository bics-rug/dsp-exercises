    "# Assignment 5: Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we are going to look into quantization. Quantisation is one of the non-idealities that we have to consider in digital signal processing. All signal we have been lookin at in previous assignments were already quantized, but you may not have noticed. This is because, in software, we use large data types like float64 that lead to low quantization errors. When capturing signals, in DSP hardware or in resource constrained computing systems, however, we will resort to data types to lower bit resolution."

    "Until now we always used the numpy standard datatype for numerical arrays, typically float64 for modern systems, to represent data. When we compute on signals, even in software, on systems that are not your typical 64 bit desktop or laptop CPU, we need to use data types of lower precsion (fp32 down to even binary). These can be GPUs, tensor cores, APUs or microcontrollers. Recently, the trend goes towards using low resolution data types even on GPUs (typically fp32) like int8 for data-intensive processes to save memory bandwidth and power.\n",
